Work plan
---------
1. The first element in the application will be an activity with an associated template.  There needed a master entity as
activity types so that they can bel selected while activities are created.
2. Step can be created by selecting created activities. The best possible approach will be to create a step first and then
create or add more activities into it.  So the pre-condition for a step is to have many activities and type exist.
3. Workflow editor, will be used to link the steps together so that a workflow can be created.
4. A work will be created in the system by selecting a workflow.
